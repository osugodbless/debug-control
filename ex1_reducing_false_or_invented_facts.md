# Objective: Identify and correct prompts that produce wrong or made-up information.

**Prompt 1:**
```
Give the capitals of five imaginary countries.
```

**Response 1:**

```
Here are five imaginary countries and their capitals:

Zorathia — Capital: Velmora

Eldoria — Capital: Silverhaven

Krythos — Capital: Drakmere

Lumaria — Capital: Aurelia City

Vandrosia — Capital: Stormwatch
```

**Prompt 2:**
```
List five real countries and their capitals.
```

**Response 2:**
```
Nigeria — Capital: Abuja

France — Capital: Paris

Japan — Capital: Tokyo

Brazil — Capital: Brasília

Canada — Capital: Ottawa
```

**Compare both results and note the differences.**

The first prompt response was incorrect as the countries and their capital were not real. However, the response for the second prompt was correct with real countries because the prompt explicitly stated that the countries should be real ones.
